# 👋 Hey! Welcome to my GitHub

## I'm Leonardo Grupioni

Software Engineer and Co-Founder at Peacore, working on building scalable, reliable, and data-driven systems.

I have a strong background in software engineering, algorithms, and applied mathematics, with hands-on experience developing full stack applications using **Python (FastAPI)**, **React**, and **cloud-native architectures on AWS**.

My work spans product development, system design, automation, and applied machine learning. I hold a **BSc in Computer Science from PUC-SP** and am an **incoming MSc student in Computer Engineering at the University of São Paulo (USP)**, focusing on **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

I am particularly interested in building intelligent systems that combine strong engineering practices with advanced data-driven methods, enabling efficient, responsible, and real-world impact solutions.
